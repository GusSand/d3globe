##For Local Development

Follow the instructions here: <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki"> github/d3/d3/wiki</a>

Browsers enforce strict security permissions to prevent you from reading files out of the local file system. To develop locally, you must run a local web server rather than using file://…. Node’shttp-server is recommended. To install:


	npm install -g http-server'


To run:

	http-server &


This will start the server on **http://localhost:8080** from the current working directory.
